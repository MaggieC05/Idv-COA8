# Idv-COA8
Funky website for asymmetrical horror game Identity V's global tournament, Call of the Abyss 8.
There are still many bugs, work in progress.
It was originally made for Codepath's web development 101 course.
Doesn't really have the best coding practices and the code might be hard to read.
